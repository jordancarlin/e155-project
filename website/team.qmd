Jordan Carlin is a junior engineering major at Harvey Mudd College interested in computer engineering and digital design. He is currently doing research as a Clay-Wolkin Fellow at Harvey Mudd's VLSI lab working on a superscalar implementation of the open-source [OpenHW-Group CVW RISC-V SoC](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cvw). He has experience with SystemVerilog and RISC-V assembly and would love to continue growing his computer engineering skills. He's always excited to learn new things and would be happy to connect with you!

Mae gâ€™ovannen! My name is Zoe Worrall, and I am currently a senior Engineering Major at Harvey Mudd College.

Although I have experience with a broad range of engineering topics including materials engineering, continuum mechanics, and manufacturing, my primary interests lie in signal processing, radio frequency, and optical systems.
