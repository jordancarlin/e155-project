title: "Jordan and Zoe E155 Final Project"

Midpoint report:
A 4-page report (plus appendices) documenting your design at the midpoint. Your report should be submitted before your scheduled checkpoint slot. The status report should include:

Schematics of anything on a breadboard,
Block diagrams of the logic on your FPGA,
An outline of the routines used on the MCU.
You should include as an appendix either your Verilog code or software that is mostly complete (but do not have to have both ready). You must be ready to demonstrate some working hardware in the lab.

Proficiency

- Clear and concise written summary of current status
[] Schematics of all breadboarded circuits
[] Block diagram of system components and the interfaces between them
[] Hardware demo functioning (potentially with some minor bugs)
[] More than 25% of the way to the final deliverable
[] Clear description of microcontroller routines
[] All external parts ordered

Excellence

[] All interfaces in the block diagram defined (e.g., SPI, I2C, GPIO)
[] Hardware demo functioning well
[] Writing is well organized
[] Solid grammar or spelling issues (no more than a few minor errors which do not detract from the point).
[] Completed riskiest element of the project
[] More than 50% of the way to the final deliverable
