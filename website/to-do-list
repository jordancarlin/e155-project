Project Final Portfolio Specs

Written documentation should follow all the specifications for written documentation as laid out in the general lab specs. In addition, the report should address these project-specific specifications.
Proficiency

Technical Information

    Bill of materials including all relevant components with quantities, part numbers, and prices.
    Microcontroller design overview: description of what the MCU is doing.
    FPGA design overview: what is the FPGA doing along with main design features.

Written Documentation

    Names and short bios of team members with link to personal website or LinkedIn profile.
    Abstract which briefly describes the main purpose and operation of the system.
    New hardware listed in section with description
    Results: What are the main results of your project.
    References: Citation (and hyperlinks where relevant) to any outside resources that were referenced in the design of the project.
    Acknowledgements
    All project code (software and HDL) included in Git repository

Writing and Organization

    Website is well organized with clear separation of relevant information.
    No more than a few minor spelling or grammar issues.
    No missing placeholders (e.g., XX) or dead hyperlinks.

Excellence
Technical Documentation

    Schematics are neatly drawn with a CAD program (e.g., KiCad). All necessary labels present (pins names & numbers, part numbers, etc.)
    Block diagram is neat and completely specified (e.g., all communication protocols labeled, bus widths indicated, etc.)

Written Documentation

    New hardware described with notes about the features to be implemented and how they go beyond the previous material covered in the course.
    Results section clearly and quantitatively outlines the key performance aspects of the design with commentary to explain the design decisions.
    References are formatted with a clean and consistent format.
    All project code is accompanied by comments throughout
    Git repository contains a README.md file to describe the main elements of the project and where they are found.

Writing and Organization

    Excellent spelling and grammar throughout

Multimedia Documentation

    Short video showcasing a demonstration of the project
    Photos documenting final design

Optional

    Photos documenting the build process
