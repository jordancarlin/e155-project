# FPGA Setup

The FPGA in this system is used to control a VGA, as well as store the RGB values of the system as left behind by the MCU control. The FPGA primarily works by running two pieces of code concurrently; one that uses combinational logic to store the current color and location of the block, which is used to update the RAM RGB array, and the other that uses a block of code to write to the VGA and cycle through a 200x200 grid to update the graphics.
