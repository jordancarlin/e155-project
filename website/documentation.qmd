Details on Proficiency and Excellency Specs:

Proficiency:
[] Project meets most of of the specifications as laid out in the proposal with explanations for any specifications that weren’t met.
    
[] System operates without any major bugs (e.g., doesn’t freeze in operation)
    
[] Document listing each spec from the proposal along with a short (e.g., 3-5 sentence) summary explaining whether the spec was met or not.

[] Technical documentation (e.g., schematics, code, block diagrams) available for review at checkoff.
    
[] Verilog HDL is functional and cleanly formatted
    
[] MCU C code is functional and cleanly formatted

Excellency: 
Project meets all the specifications as laid out in the proposal.
Project is polished (e.g., wires are hidden, any physical interfaces are well-designed and reliable, clean user interface)
Verilog code is efficient and demonstrates best coding practices (e.g., modularity, testbenches were appropriate, etc.)
C code is efficient and well organized (e.g., code encapsulated in functions and custom libraries as appropriate)
