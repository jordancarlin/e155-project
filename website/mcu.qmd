# MCU Setup

The multicore processor in this project is used to keep track of the current brush state, the color state, the thickness of the brush, and whether the brush is up or down. The system collects this data and then sends it to the FPGA board for VGA processing via a SPI package. There are two primary SPI packages used to communicate the status of bits, and they are organized such that the header of the color SPI block is easily distinguished and decoded.

## Schematic

The MCU makes use of many of the materials and ideas seen throughout the semester in MicroP's so far. It uses interrupts in order to map out the current color, with a total of seven potential colors (including erase). 

The system also implements the newer technology of analog to digital conversion (ADC) on the MCU, which is used to determine the current state of a joystick for location control, as well as a potentiometer to control the thickness of the brush at any given time (ranging from 1x1 to 2x2 to 3x3).

When compiled together, this gives @fig-largeOverview. The detailed layout of the pins can be found in the drop down which contains @fig-pinMCU.

Each of the buttons and the analog control of the joystick has an op-amp attached to it. This was done while breadboarding, as significant loading was noted specifically on the part of the joystick. The op-amps were added to the buttons as an extreme precautionary measure, although this was likely unnecessary.
:::

The program starts first by initializing all of its components before entering a while loop, which controls the main functions required of the MCU. This while loop delays for some 500 ms, before calling read_XY to find the current state of the joystick and to update the size of brush.
This information is used to determine what SPI packages are sent at the end of the while loop.
In the case that an interrupt has occured or the switch controlling whether or not the brush has been raised or lowered has changed, color_spi is updated.

The behavior of interrupts is depicted in @fig-interrupts.

## Hardware

The hardware for the board has arrived and has been implemented on a breadboard. Future plans encompass adding larger buttons for the DIP Buttons, as well as potentially building a controller that will allows the user to control many items at once with little concern for messing up wiring.

Currently, the program is able to send out all the locations necessary dependent on which thickness the current brush is. This can be seen in the set of images below:

The files are sent in this way to ensure the simplest possibe implementation on the FPGA. The FPGA board currently uses combinational logic to interpret the incoming SPI data, and as a result, by sending each pixel that should be currently turned on, the MCU prevents the FPGA from needing to use a finite state machine in order to interpret the data it is placing in the RAM at any given.

In addition, when a button is pressed, the color_spi spi packet is sent along with the location data, which contains information on whether the brush is down or up, as well as what color the current SPI bus is.

The maximum possible number of SPI packets sent in a given round is 10 (each SPI packet is considered to be to collections of 8 bits), and the minimum is 1.

A "SPI Packet", as we have deemed, can be of two types:

#### color_spi

![](mcu_images/color_spi.png)

#### loc_spi

![](mcu_images/loc_spi.png){width=70%}

These SPI are differentiated by the first three bits of the SPI message: in the case of color_spi, the first three bits will always make the value of the character greater than 200, which is an impossible for the x and y indices to be. As a result, the SPI blocks can be easily differentiated with the use of the first three bits, which the FPGA will figure out combinationally and will then use to adjust its values accordingly.

The video below is a demonstration of the data being sent out of the MCU at any given time.
